# React Avery Demo

This is my attempt at recreating Avery labels in React/JavaScript. This does not include all labels, but does give a good idea of how to generate them I think.

Some notes:

    - This is not a drop in solution, you will need to adapt to your scenario
    - There is a generator under ./src/data/data.js that generates data to test with.  Just feed it a number. (see App.js)
    - Again this does not, nor will it ever have all the labels.  I in no way want to sit down and try to recreate all those labels. Serious PITA moment.
